# note for devolopmers
opencv dlls need to be the same version of the emgucv library
opencv dlls need to be compiled on the same platform as Strabo
the debug folder needs to have x86 and x64 folders for opencv dlls
refresh (uninstall and install) tesseract if initializing the dictionary folder is a problem
x86 and x64 folders in the project folders are for tesseract
